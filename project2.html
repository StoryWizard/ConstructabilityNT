    <h3> NT Mining - Project List </h3>

  <div class="col-8_sm-12 left"</div>

    <p> During the 1980's and 1990's the managing director of ConstructabilityNT, Mark Buratovic, managed construction of the below list of Northern Territory gold exploration and gold processing projects on behalf of Nino Constructions Pty Ltd. </p>
    <p> Mark and Nino moved from project to project with great efficiency and utilised their skills and experience to enhance the timing and execution of the construction of the concrete foundations. This included crushing circuits, mill foundations, reclaim tunnels and conveyor footings of all dimensions and configurations, dependant on the clients design requirements.</p>
    <p> The great challenge of the work was the remoteness and logistics of each project, which took careful planning, coordination and precision, resulting in successful delivery of each project as promised- on time and on budget.</p>
